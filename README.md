### Project Proposal 1

#### GoldenHeart project

What if everyone took one positive action, big or small?  Golden Heart Project creates a community of people making the world more awesome by creating or accepting inspiring challenges that impact hundreds of causes. From the environment to human rights. GoldenHeart project enables 2 categories of Samaritans. First, people who desire to contribute to a social cause but lack time or are unable to do it. Second, people who have time and can do something for a cause but lack funds. GoldenHeart Project will enable the first group to create a Challenge and assign some money to it. Individuals from the Second group can search through a myriad of challenges, Pick one, Complete it and the amount associated with the challenge goes to the desired cause. This makes taking positive action and tracking your impact easy. In this way, the Golden Heart Project effectively helps to raise money as well as take effective actions for a cause.

### Project Proposal 2

#### HELP!

We have recently come across many life threatening incidents like mugging, theft and robberies happening with our friends, families and other people around. This project aims at sending emergency alerts along with the location to your friends and families in times of such misfortune. The focus of the project will be on creating a mobile app to send alerts using defined pattern of key touches, screen gesture or a single click on a home screen icon. List of alert recipients will be managed via the app and alerts will be sent as text messages or push notifications. Live location sharing to a group of people will also be enabled in order to track the person and provide help at the earliest. Feature to place call to a pre-defined contact will also be added so that you can connect with the person at the earliest to receive help.

### Project Proposal 3

#### Feed

About 150,000 tons of food is tossed out in US households each day. We attempt to solve the problem of food wastage by proposing a solution called “Feed”. Feed lets restaurant owners share their food with the people in the surrounding area. Restaurant owners register themselves on feed. Poor and hungry people searching for meal can register themselves for free on Feed. Poor and hungry people can be served meal at any time of the day. The restaurant owners/ manager will be notified immediately on screen if in case the people come within certain radius of the restaurant. The restaurant manager can then send a delivery person who is on the way for his/ her next delivery to go and deliver the leftover food to the hungry person looking for food. Feed is used to manage food donations effectively and minimizing food wastage as much as possible. In feed, only the restaurant owners can see the location of the poor/ homeless people. The homeless/hungry people cannot see the location of the restaurant or where the food is coming from, so these people won’t crowd or bother the restaurant owners by standing outside the restaurant which is the main cause of concern for restaurants who want to give away food but instead hesitate. Using Feed, this problem can be solved.
