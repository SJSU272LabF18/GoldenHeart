### Project Proposal 1

#### GoldenHeart project

An app for charities, where they can register and add their info/metadata with their web url and mission and goals. Then you develop web services on these data for any companies to use which want to embed the list of charities on their product page. when they sell a product or service they can allow their customers to choose a charity for certain percentage of the revenue to be donated.
